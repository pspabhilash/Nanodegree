Project 0: My App Portfolio
Design and build a layout in Android Studio for an app that showcases your app portfolio. Each button represents an app that you'll build in the Nanodegree program.

Project 1: Popular Movies, Stage 1
In this project, you will build an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. You will build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user.

Project 2: Popular Movies, Stage 2
In this project, you will add to the app you built in Stage 1 by building on the detail view for each movie, allowing users to 'favorite' movies, and adding a tablet layout.

Project 3: Super Duo 2

Project 4: Build It Bigger
In this project, you will use Gradle to build a joke-telling app, factoring functionality into libraries and flavors to keep the build simple. You'll also configure a Google Cloud Endpoints development server to supply the jokes.

Project 5: Make Your App Material
In this project, you will update the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications.

Project 6: Go Ubiquitous (Sunshine wear)
